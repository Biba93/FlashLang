Flash Lang 
This app is useful for all language learners. 
While learning a language we meet a lot of new words and usually, if we don’t have a dictionary or a teacher beside us, which can help us to translate some word, we turn to an online translator. For example Google Translator. 
This app is aimed to help us remember words we translate. It’s is built on the base of flash cards(a very efficient tool for memorizing information)-one side for original word, another for translation. 
App provides a translation service(based on Google Translator), flash cards itself and many tools for grouping and customizing them.
